# 1D_DDFCsparsePA
A method to reduce the Gibbs oscillation on 1D data


These are the Matlab files used in Shi, R., Jung, J.: A domain decomposition Fourier continuation method for enhanced L_1 regularization 
using the sparsity of edges in reconstructing Fourier data. J. Sci. Comput. 74(2), 851â€“871. (2018)

DDFCsparsePA_paper.m: This file shows the reconstruction of the function with different method I proposed in the article. 

DDFCsparsePA.m: This file lets the user choose the example function, the number of uniform grid points of that function, the number of 
seperate intervals and the method to get the reconstruction.
